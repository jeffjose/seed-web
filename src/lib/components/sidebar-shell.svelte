	 * it is gone — no rail, no icon strip, nothing reserved. The only thing left on
	 * screen is one icon in the top-left corner, and putting the pointer on it
	 * floats the *whole* nav back over the page until the pointer leaves.
	 *
	 * The middle state is what we dropped: a 3.5rem rail of unlabeled icons that
	 * needed a tooltip each to be usable — a menu that costs a column to say less
	 * than a menu, and which had to grow hover flyouts of its own for Accounts and
	 * Manage before their lists were reachable at all. Folding to nothing and
	 * peeking on hover gives the width back without giving up the labels.
	 *
	 * The nav body is a snippet so it can be rendered twice from one definition —
	 * once pinned in the shell, once floating in the peek. `inPeek` is only for the
	 * parts that must not run twice (see `reportMenu`).
